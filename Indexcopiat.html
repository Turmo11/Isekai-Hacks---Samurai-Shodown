    <h2>About the Game</h2>
        
    <p>Samurai Shodown is a competitive fighting game series developed by SNK for the NEO GEO platform and got released the seventh of July, 1993.

The stories take place in the 18th century in Japan, during the seclusion period. Shiro Tokisada Amakusa was slain in 1638 by the forces of the Tokugawa Shogunate and he is revived as a satanic demon. Driven by his hate for the force that killed him, he uses his dark powers to bring chaos to the world.<p>
