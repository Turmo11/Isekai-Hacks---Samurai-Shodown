Samurai Shodown is a competitive fighting game series developed by SNK for the NEO GEO platform and got released the seventh of July, 1993.

The stories take place in the 18th century in Japan, during the seclusion period.

Driven by his hate for the force that killed him, he uses his dark powers to bring chaos to the world.
